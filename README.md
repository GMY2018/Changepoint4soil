Changepoint analysis of soil moisture time series

This repository accompanies the manuscript, "A changepoint approach to modelling non-stationary soil moisture dynamics", which can be found on JRSSC (https://academic.oup.com/jrsssc/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jrsssc/qlaf004/7986097). It provides essential R code and data for running the PELT algorithm to detect the changepoints in soil moisture time series.

To try the method, download the example data and the related R script. Requres the nlmrt package to perform non-linear least squares.
